Today the sun is shining.
It is a happy day!
I have a coffee.
And my coffee is now empty.
It is still almost empty.
The birds are singing.
This is the worst story ever.
I need more coffee. :)
so i went to the local coffee
and asked for a coffee.
but the bloke at the bar said
sorry man. we run out on coffee.
